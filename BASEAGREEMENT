                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away
your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of
a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free
Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software;
it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply
it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute
copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source
code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces
of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights
or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain responsibilities
if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities
to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.

TIPPERS Registration By sending a tip to the recipient, you agree that 
the card is your own and authorize Streamlabs to charge each tip 
transaction in full. This charge is non-refundable, non-profitable, 
and/or exchangeable and cannot be withdrawn or charged back. You 
acknowledge that you are not receiving any goods/services in return for 
this tip. 

Sending Tips/Donations Streamlabs allows users to send tips through 
third party payment processors. We reserve the right to add or remove 
support for these third party payment processors at any time. The 
recipient of tips are not required to acknowledge or accept them. You 
agree that you will not hold Streamlabs liable for any unclaimed or 
unacknowledged tips. 

Fees You, the Tipper, have the option to pay for the processing fee at 
the point of the tip transaction. By checking the fee option, you agree 
to authorize Streamlabs to deduct any associated processing fees as 
needed by the payment processor. Due to currency exchange discrepancy 
from Streamlabs’ API and our payment processor’s API the total 
charge to the tipper may off by a minimal amount and any overcharged 
fees will be given to the Creator. If you decide not to opt in to pay 
the fee, the Creator is fully responsible for it. 

Your Privacy Your privacy is important to us, and you acknowledge that 
you have read in full agreement to our Privacy Policy. 

STREAMLABS ALL-STARS PROGRAM TERMS The Streamlabs All-Stars Program (the 
"Program") is brought to you by Streamlabs ("Streamlabs" or "we"). 
Participation in the Program is subject to these terms and conditions 
and Privacy Policy which are incorporated herein (collectively, the 
"Program Terms"). The benefits and rewards outlined herein are provided 
in connection with the use of the Streamlabs products. 

Eligibility In order to participate as a Program Member (defined below) 
in the Program you must have a valid and active Streamlabs account. You 
may only have one Program account ("Program Account") and may not share 
memberships or have multiple memberships. However, there may be more 
than one Program Member in a household. Memberships cannot be merged or 
transferred. During the initial phases of the Program, Streamlabs may 
make the Program available on a rolling or staggered basis such that not 
all individuals will become eligible for the Program at the same time. 
By participating in this Program you are agreeing to these Program 
Terms. If you do not agree to these Program Terms, do not participate in 
the Program. 

Membership Commencement and Tier progression When an individual becomes 
a Program Member, they start in the Program Tier that corresponds to the 
number of Program Points of their CCV. Each Program Member may advance 
to the next Membership Tier by accruing the minimum number of Program 
Points required for each Tier. Once the Program Member becomes eligible 
to move into a new Membership Tier, the Program Member will see it 
become available to “unlock” within their dashboard. The Program 
Member must click the “unlock” button to progress into the new 
Membership Tier. 

Bonus Points At times, the Program may offer the Program Members certain 
opportunities to acquire additional Program Points (“Bonus Points”) 
through enabling Streamlabs products and completing certain tasks 
related to the Streamlabs products. Bonus Points tasks will be listed 
within the Dashboard as a checklist with the number of Bonus Points 
eligible for completing each task. Once the tasks are completed, the 
Bonus Points will immediately be applied to your account. 

Giveaways No purchase or payment necessary to enter and win the 
Sweepstakes on Streamlabs All-Stars ("Streamlabs"), and everyone who is 
eligible to enter has an equal chance of winning. Streamlabs is the 
sponsor of all Sweepstakes (the "Giveaways") hosted on the Streamlabs 
website. The Giveaways are not sponsored, endorsed, administered by, or 
associated with any other organization. These official rules apply to 
every Giveaway campaign we run—but sometimes we also have extra 
information or requirements. In those cases, we publish extra rules on 
the Giveaway campaign. Usually those rules work with these, but 
occasionally, we may need to adjust some of these rules for that 
campaign. We’ll tell you about those changes on the campaign page. For 
full contest rules see Streamlabs All-Stars Contest Rules. 

Account Termination Participation in the Program is a privilege granted 
to Program Members, and as such can be suspended, revoked, or terminated 
at any time by us for any reason. If your Program Membership is 
terminated, all Points associated with your Program Membership and any 
Membership Benefits will be forfeited immediately upon termination. If 
your Program Membership is terminated due to fraudulent activity or 
noncompliance with these Program Terms, or the Streamlabs Terms, in 
addition to forfeiting all Points and Membership Benefits associated 
with your Program Membership immediately, you cannot participate in or 
rejoin the Program. 

Program Changes and Termination We reserve the right to change or 
terminate the Program, or any part thereof, at any time without notice 
and without further obligations to Program Members, including, but not 
limited to modifications which: a) govern how Points are earned on and 
after the date of change; or b) change the value of benefits. No Points 
will be earned or redeemed after the effective date of termination. Any 
and all changes and/or amendments to these Program Terms will become 
binding upon all members immediately. 

AFFILIATE TERMS As an affiliate, you have a unique Streamlabs URL that 
will link to a download of Streamlabs Desktop. For each unique 
individual who installs Streamlabs Desktop, you'll earn compensation. 

Payments will be made monthly. Please note that you must meet a minimum 
threshold of $10 to qualify for payments each month. If you don't meet 
the minimum threshold in a given month, all of your installs will 
carryover to the following month. Your affiliate information and FAQs 
are located in your Streamlabs dashboard. Streamlabs reserves the right 
to terminate participation in the Affiliate program at our sole 
discretion, as well as audit the payouts to Affiliates should there be 
fraud, or potential fraud on the account or Affiliate Link. As an 
Affiliate you agree to engage in lawful use of the Affiliate Link, and 
will not engage in fraudulent activities and Prohibited Uses, referenced 
within this Terms of Service. Running pay-per-click advertising 
campaigns on your affiliate link is not allowed. You will only be paid 
for unique installations that are the result of content you own such as 
tutorials, blogs and videos. 

As an Affiliate of Streamlabs, you are not an employee or contractor, 
and have full creative control over your content. Streamlabs grants 
Affiliates a limited, non-exclusive and revocable license to utilize the 
Streamlabs marker and name, in connection with the Affiliate Link and 
download, for the duration of your participation in the Affiliate 
Program. 

Affiliates are paid at the beginning of every month for the previous 
month. Currently, we only support PayPal as the payout method. 
Streamlabs reserves the sole right to determine what constitutes a valid 
installation, and should there become a dispute and an audit, it is the 
Affiliate’s responsibility to provide proof that an installation in 
question was valid. 

More information on the Affiliate program can be found within the 
Affiliate dashboard, and how we collect, track and use your information 
is within the Privacy Policy. 

YOUTUBE API Streamlabs utilizes YouTube’s API, and as a user of 
Streamlabs, you are agreeing to be bound to YouTube’s Terms of Service 
and Privacy Policy. You can find more information on YouTube’s terms 
here, and Google’s terms here. 

CREDIT CARD TERMS Streamlabs utilizes third party service Stripe and 
Braintree to process credit cards. By agreeing to Streamlabs’ Terms of 
Service, you are also agreeing to Stripe’s Terms of Service, located 
at https://stripe.com/us/terms. 

In the event a Chargeback is issued, you are immediately liable for the 
full amount of the transaction related to the Chargeback. You are also 
liable for any associated fees, fines, expenses, or penalties. You agree 
that any associated fees, fines, or expenses will be deducted from your 
Streamlabs or Campaign balance. 

At any point our payment processors determine you are incurring 
excessive Chargebacks, your Streamlabs account may results in additional 
controls and restrictions on your balance. 

CREATOR SITES TERMS FOR CREATORS Your Content When you upload content to 
Creator Sites, you still own it. You do, however, give us permission to 
use it in ways necessary to provide, improve, promote and protect our 
services. For example, when you upload a photo, you give us the right to 
save it and display it on your site at your direction. We also may 
promote or feature your site, but you can opt out if you don’t want us 
to do that. 

Your User Content Stays Yours. Users of the Services (whether you or 
others) may provide us with content, including without limitation text,

Content"). Your User Content stays yours, except for the limited rights 
that enable us to provide, improve, promote and protect the Services as 
described in this Agreement. 

Your License To Us. When you provide User Content via the Services, you 
grant Creator Sites (including our third party hosting providers acting 
on our behalf) a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable,

those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make

marks or logos included on Your Sites. You grant us a perpetual, 
worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive right and license to use any 
version of Your Sites, or any portion of Your Sites, including without 
limitation names, trademarks, service marks or logos on Your Sites, for 
the limited purpose of Creator Sites marketing and promotional 
activities. For example, we may feature Your Sites on our Templates 
page, on the Customers sections of our sites or on our social media 
accounts. You waive any claims against us relating to any moral rights, 
artists’ rights or any other similar rights worldwide that you may 
have in or to Your Sites or names, trademarks, service marks or logos on 
Your Sites and any right of inspection or approval of any such use. You 
can opt out of being featured through your Account. This Section does 
not affect any rights you may have under applicable data protection 
laws.

services. Also keep in mind that what you upload may be publicly 
viewable. 

Only Use Content You’re Allowed To Use. You represent and warrant that 
you own all rights to your User Content or otherwise have (and will 
continue to have) all rights and permissions to legally use, share, 
display, transfer and license your User Content via the Services and in 
the manner required by this Agreement. If we use your User Content in 
the ways described in this Agreement, you represent and warrant that 
such use will not infringe or violate the rights of any third party, 
including without limitation any copyrights, trademarks, privacy rights, 
publicity rights, contract rights, trade secrets or any other 
intellectual property or proprietary rights. Also, content on the 
Services may be protected by others' intellectual property, trade secret 
or other rights. Please don't copy, upload, download or share content 
unless you have the right to do so. 

Our Intellectual Property Creator Sites is protected by various 
intellectual property laws. This section summarizes what we own and how 
we share. 

Creator Sites Owns Creator Sites The Services are protected by 
copyright, trademark and other US and foreign laws. This Agreement 
doesn't grant you any right, title or interest in the Services, 
others’ User Content, our trademarks, logos or other brand features or 
intellectual property or trade secrets or others’ content in the 
Services. You agree not to change, translate or otherwise create 
derivative works of the Services or others’ User Content.

demo content, including without limitation text, photos, images, 
graphics, audio and video (“Demo Content”), to provide you with 
ideas or inspiration. Unless we tell you otherwise, Demo Content (or any 
portion of it) may not remain on Your Site or be distributed, publicly 
displayed, publicly performed or otherwise published. 

Our Betas Are Still In Beta We may release products and features that 
we’re still testing and evaluating. Those Services will be marked as 
beta, preview or early access (or a similar phrasing), and may not be as 
reliable as our other Services. 

Our Rights To operate effectively and protect the security and integrity 
of Creator Sites, we need to maintain control over what happens on our 
services. 

We reserve these rights, which we may exercise at any time and in our 
sole discretion, and without liability or notice to you (except where 
prohibited by applicable law): (a) we may change parts or all of the 
Services and their functionality; (b) we may suspend or discontinue 
parts or all of the Services; (c) we may terminate, suspend, restrict or 
disable your access to or use of parts or all of the Services; (d) we 
may terminate, suspend, restrict or disable access to your Account or 
parts, some or all of Your Sites; and (e) we may change our eligibility 
criteria to use the Services (and if such eligibility criteria changes 
are prohibited by law where you live, we may revoke your right to use 
the Services in that jurisdiction). 

How We Handle Ownership Disputes Sometimes, ownership of an Account or 
site is disputed between parties, such as a business and its employees, 
or a web designer and a client. We try not to get involved in these 
disputes. However, we reserve the right, at any time and in our sole 
discretion, and without notice to you, to determine rightful Account or 
site ownership and to transfer an Account or site to such owner. Our 
decision in that respect is final. If we feel that we can’t reasonably 
determine the rightful owner, we reserve the right to suspend an Account 
or site until the disputing parties reach a resolution. We also may 
request documentation, such as a government-issued photo ID, credit card 
invoice or business license, to help determine the rightful owner. 

HTTPS Encryption We may offer HTTPS encryption for Your Sites. By 
registering a custom domain via the Services, or pointing a custom 
domain to the Services, you authorize us to create and maintain a 
certificate for the limited purpose of providing HTTPS for Your Sites. 

Copyright We comply with copyright law, and respond to complaints about 
copyright infringement in accordance with our Copyright Policy. We 
respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. We 
respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with 
the law, and such notices should be reported via the process described 
in our Copyright Policy, which is incorporated by reference into this 
Agreement. We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to 
be infringing, and to terminate Accounts of repeat infringers without 
any refunds. 

Paid Services And Fees Certain Services are paid services. This section 
explains how we handle payments for those paid services. For certain 
paid services, such as domain registrations and site subscriptions, 
we’ll automatically bill you in regular intervals (such as monthly or 
annually) unless you cancel your subscription. You can do that anytime 
through our customer support or by emailing support@streamlabs.com 

Fees You can access certain portions of the Services by submitting a fee 
payment (such additional services, “Paid Services”). Paid Services 
will remain in effect until cancelled or terminated in accordance with 
this Agreement. We’ll tell you about fees for Paid Services before 
charging you. You may cancel Paid Services at any time via the Services. 
If you don't pay for Paid Services on time, we reserve the right to 
suspend or cancel your access to the Paid Services. Transaction fees and 
additional fees may also apply to certain portions of the Services, and 
we’ll tell you about those fees before charging you. 

Taxes All fees are exclusive of applicable national, provincial, state, 
local or other taxes (“Taxes”), unless explicitly stated otherwise. 
You're responsible for all applicable Taxes, and we'll charge Taxes in 
addition to the fees for the Services when required to do so. If you're 
exempt from Taxes, you must provide us with valid tax exemption 
documentation. We reserve the right to determine if the documentation 
provided is valid. Tax exemption will, provided we’re satisfied it’s 
valid and applicable, only apply from and after the date we receive such 
documentation. If Creator Sites has a legal obligation to pay or collect 
indirect Taxes (such as value-added tax or goods and services tax) on 
the sale to you under the laws of your country (where you are 
established, have a permanent address or usually reside), you shall be 
liable for payment of any such indirect Taxes. Where Creator Sites does 
not have a legal obligation to pay or collect indirect Taxes on a sale 
of Paid Services to you, you may be required to self-assess those Taxes 
under the applicable laws of your country (where you are established, 
have a permanent address or usually resides). 

Automatic Subscription Renewals To ensure uninterrupted service, we'll 
automatically bill you for certain Paid Services from the date you 
submit your initial payment and on each renewal period afterwards until 
cancellation. Your renewal period will be equal in time to the renewal 
period of your current subscription. For example, if you're on an annual 
subscription plan, each billable renewal period will be for one (1) 
year. We’ll automatically charge you the applicable amount using the 
payment method you have on file with us. We’ll let you know in advance 
if you’re purchasing a Paid Service that includes auto-renewal 
payments. You can disable auto-renewal at any time via the Services or 
emailing customer support at support@streamlabs.com 

Refunds While you may cancel any Paid Services at any time, you won't be 
issued a refund except if requested within 14 days of purchase and no 
paid features have been used. Paid features include, but are not limited 
to Creator Sites, Domains, Themes, and Apps. 

Fee Changes We may change our fees at any time. We’ll provide you with 
advance notice of these fee changes via the Services. New fees will not 
apply retroactively. If you don't agree with the fee changes, you have 
the right to reject the change by canceling the applicable Paid Service 
before your next payment date. 

Chargebacks If you contact your bank or credit card company to decline, 
chargeback or otherwise reverse the charge of any payable fees to us 
(“Chargeback”), we may automatically terminate your Account. If you 
have questions about a payment made to us, we encourage you to contact 
customer support via the Services or by emailing support@streamlabs.com 
before filing a Chargeback. We reserve our right to dispute any 
Chargeback. 

Our Payment Processor We use a third party payment processor (the 
“Payment Processor”) to bill you through a payment account linked to 
your Account. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, 
conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor, in addition to 
this Agreement. Our current Payment Processor is Braintree, and your 
payments are processed by Braintree in accordance with Braintree’s 
terms of service and privacy policy. You agree to pay us, through the 
Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any 
purchase in accordance with the applicable payment terms. You agree to 
make the payment using the payment method you provide with your Account. 
We reserve the right to correct, or to instruct our Payment Processor to 
correct any errors or mistakes, even if payment has already been 
requested or received. 

Fees For Third Party Services Third Party Services purchased via the 
Services may be subject to different refund policies that those Third 
Party Services determine, and they may be non-refundable. The purchase 
terms and conditions for such Third Party Services may be displayed 
during the purchase process, such as through a link to the purchase 
terms and conditions. It's your responsibility to verify your ability to 
purchase, cancel or obtain a refund for a Third Party Service. Unless 
otherwise stated in this Agreement, we don’t offer refunds for 
purchases of Third Party Services. 

Domains This section explains how we provide our domain services. Your 
domain registrations are also subject to agreements with third parties, 
including ICANN and our third party registrar partners. We work with 
third party registrars to provide you with domain services. When you 
register a domain name, or renew or transfer an existing domain name, 
via the Services, you are bound by the relevant registrar’s terms and 
conditions. Registrars are a Third Party Service, as defined below. 
Currently, the registrar for the services on Creator Sites is Namecheap, 
and by accepting these Terms, you also agree to be bound by 
Namecheap’s Terms located here and their Domain Terms located here. In 
the future, we reserve the right to transfer the domains to another 
domain registrar, or add additional domain registrars. This information 
will be made available to users. Should you have any questions about 
domains, or your domain, please email support@streamlabs.com 

Email Hosting Creator Sites offers email hosting services. Should you 
opt-in to these services, we utilize a third party email hosting 
service, Mailgun to facilitate the forwarding and outbounding of emails 
through an smtp server, to the email indicated at signup. You agree to 
be bound by the terms of Mailgun located here and the Mailgun privacy 
policy located here. The Creator Sites Services does not store or 
maintain copies of emails or content on our site or servers. 

ICANN Your use of our domain services is subject to the policies, 
including without limitation the dispute resolution policies, of the 
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”). Your 
rights and responsibilities as a domain name registrant under ICANN’s 
2009 Registrar Accreditation Agreement are summarized here. You can 
learn more about domain name registration in general here. Country code 
top level domain names may not be subject to ICANN policies. In such 
cases, the applicable policies are set forth in the Namecheap Terms. 

Transfers, Renewals And No Refunds Due to the complex nature of third 
party domain registrars, domain transfer requests must be made manually 
to support@streamlabs.com. Domain transfers are not eligible for 
refunds. For renewals, we or our registrar will try to provide you with 
notice before your scheduled domain renewal date. However, you agree 
that renewing your domain is solely your responsibility. We don't offer 
refunds for domain renewals.

text, or other materials (collectively, "User Submissions") to or 
through the Services. When you provide User Submissions, you grant to 
Streamlabs, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and partners a 
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully sub-licenseable license to

create derivative works of those User Submissions, and your name, voice,

agree that neither we nor our parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, 
employees, or agents will be liable for User Submissions or any loss or 
damage resulting from User Submissions.

password-protected area. Accordingly, you should not provide User 
Submissions that you want protected from others.

Streamlabs the license above and that none of your User Submissions are 
defamatory, violate any rights of third parties (including intellectual 
property rights or rights of publicity or privacy), or violate 
applicable law.

Disputes - ARBITRATION Before bringing a formal legal case, please first 
try contacting our Customer Support team. Most disputes can be resolved 
that way. 

To the extent permitted under applicable law, any and all disputes, 
claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, 
the breach thereof, or any use of the Websites (including all commercial 
transactions conducted through the Website) ("Claims"), except for 
claims filed in a small claims court that proceed on an individual 
(non-class, non-representative) basis, shall be settled by binding 
arbitration before a single arbitrator appointed by the American 
Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its then governing 
rules and procedures, including the Supplementary Procedures for 
Consumer-Related Disputes, where applicable. In agreeing to arbitrate 
all Claims, you and Streamlabs waive all rights to a trial by jury in 
any action or proceeding involving any Claim. The arbitration shall be 
held in San Francisco, California, and judgment on the award rendered by 
the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. 
This arbitration undertaking is made pursuant to and in connection with 
a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by 
and construed and interpreted in accordance with the Federal Arbitration 
Act at 9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq. This arbitration provision shall 
survive termination of this Agreement. Subject to the limitations set 
forth below, the arbitrator shall have authority to award legal and 
equitable relief available in the courts of the State of California, 
provided that: 

The arbitrator shall not have authority to award punitive damages; and 
Any and all claims shall be arbitrated on an individual basis only, and 
shall not be consolidated or joined with or in any arbitration or other 
proceeding involving a Claim of any other party. You and Streamlabs 
agree that the arbitrator shall have no authority to arbitrate any Claim 
as a class action or in any other form other than on an individual 
basis. For any Claims that are not subject to arbitration: (a) the 
exclusive jurisdiction and venue for proceedings involving Claims shall 
be the courts of competent jurisdiction sitting within San Francisco 
County, California (the "Forum"), and the parties hereby waive any 
argument that any such court does not have personal jurisdiction or that 
the Forum is not appropriate or convenient; (b) you and Streamlabs waive 
any and all rights to trial by jury with respect to any Claims. In the 
event that either party initiates a proceeding involving any Claim other 
than an arbitration in accordance with this Section, or initiates a 
proceeding involving a Claim under this Section other than in the Forum, 
the other party shall recover all attorneys' fees and expenses 
reasonably incurred in enforcing this Agreement to arbitrate and the 
Forum to which the parties have herein agreed. NO CLASS ACTIONS. We all 
agree that we can only bring a claim against each other on an individual 
basis. That means: (a) neither you nor Streamlabs can bring a claim as a 
plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action or 
representative action; (b) an arbitrator cannot combine more than one 
person’s claim into a single case, and cannot preside over any 
consolidated, class or representative arbitration proceeding (unless we 
both agree to change this); (c) an arbitrator’s decision or award in 
one person’s case can only impact the person who brought the claim, 
not other Streamlabs users, and cannot be used to decide other disputes 
with other users. If a court decides that this subsection on "No Class 
Actions" is not enforceable or valid, then the entire section covering 
Disputes will be null and void, but, the rest of the terms of these 
Terms will still apply. 

Miscellaneous these Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive 
laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws 
principles. Any claim or dispute between you and Streamlabs that arises 
in whole or in part from these Terms, the Websites or any Contest shall 
be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in 
San Francisco County, California. 

Nothing in these Terms shall create or confer any rights or other 
benefits in favor of any third parties except as specifically provided 
herein. By participating in any Contest on the Websites, you agree to 
indemnify, protect, defend and hold harmless Streamlabs, its parents, 
subsidiaries, affiliates and divisions, and their respective directors, 
officers, employees, agents and representatives, from and against any 
and all third party claims, liabilities, losses, damages, injuries, 
demands, actions, causes of action, suits, proceedings, judgments and 
expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs and other 
legal expenses including, without limitation, those costs incurred at 
the trial and appellate levels and in any bankruptcy, reorganization, 
insolvency or other similar proceedings, and any other legal expenses 
(collectively, "Claims") arising from or connected with your use of the 
Websites, any payment methods used, any funding of your account, and/or 
your participation in any Contest. The Websites may contain links to 
third party websites that are not owned or controlled by Streamlabs. 
Streamlabs has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the 
content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In 
addition, Streamlabs will not and cannot censor or edit the content of 
any third-party site. By using the Websites, you expressly relieve 
Streamlabs from any and all liability arising from your use of any 
third-party website. Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you 
leave the Websites and to read the terms and conditions and privacy 
policy of each other website that you visit. 

Nothing in these Terms shall create or be deemed to create a 
partnership, agency, trust arrangement, fiduciary relationship or joint 
venture between you and Streamlabs. 

No professional or amateur sports league or any team associated with any 
professional or amateur sports league is associated with Streamlabs or 
in any way affiliated or associated with the Contests. 

Third-party online publishers that refer users to the Streamlabs website 
shall not be responsible or liable for the Streamlabs website or any of 
the content, software, or functions made available on, or accessed 
through, or sent from, the Streamlabs website. 

If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of 
competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not 
affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which 
shall remain in full force and effect. 

No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or 
continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Streamlabs' 
failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not 
constitute a waiver of such right or provision. 

Streamlabs reserves the right to amend these Terms at any time and 
without notice, and it is your responsibility to review these Terms for 
any changes. If you continue to use the Services after we change these 
Terms, you accept all changes. The failure of Streamlabs to comply with 
any provision of these Terms due to an act of God, hurricane, war, fire, 
riot, earthquake, terrorism, act of public enemies, actions of 
governmental authorities outside of the control of the Company 
(excepting compliance with applicable codes and regulations) or other 
force majeure event will not be considered a breach of these Terms.
